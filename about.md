I write code to make certain websites run and look beautiful. And 
I write some other code that has nothing to do with websites just to 
have fun. Mostly struggling with Javascript, Ruby and now some Clojure.
Wrote trace ammounts of code in Go, Forth, Haskell, Rust, Pascal, asm, 
      R and&nbsp;C.

Currently working as a grumpy frontend developer at 
[Bookmate][bookmate].

I do need to write a proper about page, but life gets in the way all the 
time
:/
