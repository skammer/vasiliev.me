I write code to make certain websites run and look beautiful. And 
I write some other code that has nothing to do with websites just to have fun.  
Mostly dealing with Javascript, Clojure and Ruby.
Wrote trace amounts of code in Go, Forth, Haskell, Rust, Pascal, asm, 
      R and&nbsp;C.

Currently working as a grumpy frontend developer at [Trucker Path][Trucker 
Path]{:target="_blank"}.

I do need to write a proper about page, but life gets in the way all the 
time
