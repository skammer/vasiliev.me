I write code to make certain websites run and look beautiful. And 
I write some other code that has nothing to do with websites just to 
have fun.

Currently working as a grumpy frontend developer at 
[Bookmate][bookmate].

I do need to write a proper about page, but life gets in the way al the 
time
:/
